# Wordpress and Gulp

This repository is a simple example that shows how to use Wordpress and Gulp together.

It was used in my [Code & Coffee meetup presentation](http://www.meetup.com/Code-Coffee-Vancouver/events/231709823/) on June 2016 and it is based on [blankslate](https://wordpress.org/themes/blankslate/) theme.
